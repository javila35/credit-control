# What is this? 

I've been working on tackling credit card/loan debt that I've accrued since the pandemic. I'm tackling two problems with this project:

1. Debt can feel overwhelming. From my research there aren't many free tools that will do what this app can do.
2. Being honest about struggling with debt is hard so this is my way of opening up and sharing that struggle. I know I'm not the only one whose gone through this.

## Goals for the app

- Enter credit card / loan information such as **APR, limit, and current balance** and get back a **visualization of a 12 month payment plan**.
- **Enter monthly charges and payments.** You may need to use the cards as you're paying it down. You can enter charges for the month as you go and keep the balance and utilization current.
- **Dashboard view** for visualizing data from all CC / loan sources, with total monthly payment.
- *Stretch* **Adjustable dashboard** that will allow users to adjust payment plans without modifying data to imagine different payment plan approaches.
- *Stretch* Information about different approaches to tackling debt. I am not a financial advisor, and I will not be making suggestions. But I'd like to link articles that relate to what the user may being doing on the site.
